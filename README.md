3. Fig.R2S shows more results on real rainy images.

4. More visualization of feature maps are located under 'Feature_Maps' (Click to see more to get a better understanding on what knowledge are learned by our model)ï¼š

      -/Feature_Maps/Rainy_Images: Rainy images are located under this path;

      -/Feature_Maps/ENT_FM: Feature maps after entanglement are located under this path;

      -/Feature_Maps/MAIN_FM: Feature maps from the main encoder branch are located under this path;
      
      -/Feature_Maps/RES_FM: Feature maps from the residual encoder branch are located under this path;

5. All feature maps, and de-raining results of images from different datasets, and all codes will be released in this repository after paper acceptance.
